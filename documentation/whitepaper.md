# Quantum blockchain (QBC)

Blockchain solution for everyday multi service application. 

## Purpose

It started as a purely academic experiment, and it is still considered exactly that.

Main prpose of QBC is to be as generelly useful to anyone needing blockchain to strengten data security but provide possibility of reducing throughput of the system as little as possible.

Built with integration and decoupling possibilities in mind, with idea to provide nice APIs and multi variant configurable solution. 

## What is general purpose blockchain

**In short:** It is general purpose database that is fully replicated across arbitrary number of nodes.

For more detailed answer we got to look at long list of resources I prepared [here](). Just a glance at content of given document tells you that world is still figuring out what is blockchain and what exactly this new piece of tech is able to solve for us.

On the other hand, what is basic set of features general purpose blockchain should have?

## Base set of features needed to be generally applicable

### It should be a tool, not a star of the system

Obviously, if we are building something to be generally used as a suplement to applications, we should have something that is:
* Easy to deploy
* Highly configurable (it should adopt to needs of a system, not vice versa)
* Integration into the system should be super simple (e.g. you deploy and configure it and after that it all goes through simple RESTful API)
